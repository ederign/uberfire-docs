#Plugins
UberFire was conceived to be a high modularized  framework, so basically it's possible to select whatever you want for your application.

UberFire modules are named plugins, so everything can be considered a plugin (from a simple Screen, to VFS or Security). With such approach UF allows Apps to select what they want and also create your own.

PlugIn are classified as compile time (maven module) and runtime. Most of components available are compile time, but UF also enable extensions on runtime, basically for UI components (that basically uses UFJS to extend it)
